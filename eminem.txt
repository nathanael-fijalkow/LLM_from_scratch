deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak   a revolver and a   see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from     though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel

anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a

better go get revival but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom if i don't pull myself from the

'cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they've been puttin' me through the ringer so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners

nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits when it's time

your case better make sure you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the

pt i   hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you won't loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through   black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down 'profile' then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin' from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you're hidin' that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy black boy we don't get your culture and we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man don't tell us your attitude's a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers

someone's tryna summon someone i know something's comin' but i'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothin' get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means i'm sellin' my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya how 'bout that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is somethin' i never bowout at i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a lovehate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are countin' me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept goin' i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause you're moving onto the next but is your respect gone cause someone told me that   gwen stefani kings never die   eminem don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir you ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer wouldn't even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say i've been upstaged why am i online it's driving me crazy i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge on what's hot but i'm not one to conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear 'em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someone's gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage they so want a champion to fall it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why can't we win 'em all so fuck what these cynics say it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta with this pentup rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again cause all the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just don't mean jack anymore if i'm here today and gone tomorrow and i'm not gonna be   gwen stefani here to stay even when i'm gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   eminem i want it i'm comin' to get it so you son of a bitches don't duck youre gonna get riddick bowed critics'll end up in critical think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked and i ain't stopping 'til i'm on top again all alone and on a throne like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode i've been owed tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard it broke my collarbone and when it's my time to go i'm still not leaving stop for no one i don't know but i've been told an obstacle that blocks your road ya knock it over time to go for the pot of gold cause   eminem they say kings never die just ask jam master jay they just grow wings and they fly so hands up reach for the sky try to hold on and prolong these moments cause in a blink of an eye they'll be over    eminem so you're tryna secure your legacy like shakur and ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were so before you're leavin' this earth you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk deacon of words syllable genius at work plus i'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness kill 'em with meanness i went from powdered milk and farina to flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts at gilbert's to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers i made it to the silverscreen but rocky's still what the theme is khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat aint the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is it's that soundbombing thirstin howl common

eminem came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin' but don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speakin' to children everything was happenin' so fast it was like i blinkedsold three million then it all went blank all i remember is feelin' ridiculous cause i was gettin' sick of this feelin' like i'm always under attack man i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin' women dishin' but really thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say it's just my opinion if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear end that's why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i'd just zone out good luck tryin' to convince a blonde it's like tellin' gwen stefani she sold out cause i was tryna leave no doubt in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now because everybody knows   skylar grey everybody knows that you're just an

authenticity you'd never even see but it's everything to me it's my credibility you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me but yet i'm still unsigned havin' a rough time sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes go to work and serve mcs in the lunchline but when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go who must i show to bust my flow where must i go who must i know or am i just another crab in the bucket cause i ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot fuck it maybe i need a new outlet i'm startin' to doubt shit

i'm always stuck in this battlin' mode my defenses are so up but one thing i don't want is pity from no one this city is no fun there is no sun and it's so dark sometimes i feel like i'm just bein' pulled apart from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not what i'm doin' i just blow my head is a stove top i just explode the kettle gets so hot sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that i don't got but i've learned it's time for me to uturn yo it only takes one time for me to get burned ain't no fallin' no next time i meet a new girl i can no longer play stupid or be immature i got every ingredient all i need is the courage like i already got the beat all i need is the words got the urge suddenly it's a surge suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred time to show these free world leaders the three and a third i am no longer scared now i'm free as a bird then i

final chapter why 'cause i'm either frying after oh or they gon' give me the needle what like a vinyl scratcher dj yeah i'm a card like hallmark at walmart with a small cart buying wall art and y'all who claim to be dogs aren't no bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf but y'all pickin' the wrong tree they call me dog because i'm barking bar king bark bark barking and i got a lot yeah like where cars park i'd describe it as bowling why ball hard ball's hard 'cause the gutter's where my mind is and when it's in this frame better split like the five and the ten 'cause without a second to spare i'm strikin' again and when the beat is up my alley i go right for the pens pins the cypher begins i'm talkin' smack like heroin the mic's a syringe it's like a binge vicodin i would liken to tin my mind is a recycling bin there's no place i never been but i never budge and i never bend you hyperextend on me this game's life it depends like adult diapers for men even when i'm rappin' less stellar it's sour grapes i still whine i'm the best seller cellar like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through dre's booth and go straight through your grapefruit no escape route so you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you but if bars were semimac's i'd be the mad hatter 'cause i got so many caps and you don't have

and everyone should get along okay children quiet down quiet down children i'd like to duce our new substitute teacher for the day his name is mr shady children quiet down please brian don't throw that shut up mr shady will be your new substitute while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia he's got aids good luck mr shady   hi there little boys and girls fuck you today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bob's thirty and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 'til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want itit's bad for you   see children drugs are bad come on and if you don't believe me ask your dad ask him man and if you don't believe him ask your mom that's right she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs that's right so you don't act like everyone else does uhhuh and there's really nothin' else to say sing along drugs are just bad mmkay   my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut huh speakin' of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels ecstasyit's the worst drug in the world if someone ever offers it to you don't do it kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back so don't get attached or it'll attack every bone in your back meet zach twentyone years old after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches he's on donald's carpet layin' horizontal barfin' bleh and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 'cause they took it too so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac so don't even feed that to squirrels class 'cause it's bad for you   see children drugs are bad that's right and if you don't believe me ask your dad that's right and if you don't believe him ask your mom you can she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs don't smoke crack so you don't act like everyone else does that's right and there's really nothin' else to say but umm drugs are just bad mmkay   and last but not least one of the most humongous problems among young people today is fungus it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yumyum then you start to see some dumb stuff and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em and sometimes you see things that aren't there like what like fat women in gstrings with orange hair mr shady what's a gstring it's yarn claire women stick 'em up their behinds go out and wear 'em huh and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms whoops did i say 'magic mushrooms' i meant fungus your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue how come 'cause it comes from a cow's dung gross see drugs are bad it's a common fact but your mom and dad know that's all that i'm good at oh but don't be me 'cause if you grow up and you go and od they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee and get a disguise and hide 'cause it'll be my fault so don't do drugs and do exactly as i don't 'cause i'm bad for you   see children drugs are bad uhhuh and if you don't believe me ask your dad put that down and if you don't believe him ask your mom you can ask she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time and she will so kids say no to drugs say no so you don't act like

sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad disgruntled had some struggles yeah but that passion and hunger's back what a fantastic juggling act and the way i flip my tongue on the track it's like verbal acrobatics but in fact last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic i fuckin' crashed my hovercraft after i strapped a duffel bag to my back and stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it and an elastic bungee strap rubber plaster a thumb tack and a piece of plastic bubble wrap went spastic and fuckin' snapped jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid stumbled back recovered back flipped and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat and for my last trick lunge on back latch on a nasa shuttle flap fuckin' snap the rudder in half chuckled and laughed utter my last rebuttal and just as i'm to come crashin' i grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat rub my magic mushroom tat for luck then splat get up from that face taped to a waste

eminem  royce da  '  i've always looked at battle rap as competition or war and the main objective is to destroy completely fuckin obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything whatever the fuck you can to get a reaction from the crowd so nothing's off limits i need you to spit that lyrical miracle in the swimming pool   before this kicks off let me set my balls on this tees 'cause im dottin' i's every time i cross one of these there's not a redeeming quality at all in me it's impossible seems like an implausible dream positive clean thoughts intervene but they're all either altered and mean assault and demean tossed and they're being lost in the scheme squashed in between a brainwashing machine like an islamic regime a jihadist extreme radical suicide bomber that's seeing ariana grande sing her last song of the evening and as the audience from the damn concert is leaving detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region im not gonna finish that for obvious reasons but bring your dogs ima muzzle 'em im not middle eastern but i'll make a bitch rock a hijab and at least a extra large in a tshirt headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet hasta la

stretched out like a baby tshirt on ric flair as i rip tear anal beads in a split rear spray febreze in the chick's hair make her wheeze tryna get air i played for keeps there's no escaping me i have a bitch scared and chained to me and throw away the key and she'll be so afraid to leave that even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up it's impossible like rapin' a slut we stay buttnaked and fuck you're close wait for you what my idea you comin' too is waking you up with smelling salts after i quaalude your cup that'll

crisis a nuisance who i influence i give two shits if they wanna license my music to entice with then use the shit like it's the blueprint for isis recruitment    excuse me while i stare into space for a few in a daze or a haze glazed over crazed warped loon mental cased off always had a straightforward view but you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel no one's ever sank lower shrewd and way more rude beastmode like a lawnmower blade rolled through it and this has little to do with bein' gay boy it's just where the wordplay's goin' but ain't much i can say or do 'cause ain't no excuse the way i go at you censored you say i'm always screwfaced so if i look your way you're screwed 'cause if looks could kill i could start a hate war too 'cause i'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you    let's take it back before the tightlyworn pants to the nike jordan hats the stripe lee's jordache and the white tees lightning storms might be formed fast such a frightening forecast but when you're slightly hoarse rasp from the cyphering or gasp but still reciting your raps while you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much you're always reminded of your past 'cause your heiny's sore that's 'cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass from the night before last no good but rap's somethin' i'm toogoodformyowngood at fuck adulthood i'm a grownup brat where your cojones at mine are always being rode in fact they're frozen you ever seen a culdesac so big they fell out my scrotum i just sewed 'em back    dick so long need a shoulderstrap for that gotta unroll it and fold it back so difficult to wrap in the prophylactic it overlaps it so i pack a trojan so fat when i lay it flat it's like a yoga mat make a bitch think she's in aerobics class the bear you don't wanna poke is back the backbone of rap your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks when i appear my peers stop hearts fall in their stomach their spirits drop careers flop their gears lock severe shock fear at the mere thought lyrics are toptier i'm so high at the top i'm in the sky when i talk bitch i'm so fly when i walk my ears pop   oh and i'm just playin' ladies you know i love you i got a idea for a line
still love me take this you ready one two three   the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you more you don't want me i just want you more i buy you flowers you throw 'em at me i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 'cause you love me and i love you more   it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit we say we do it for our baby but we don't we do it for us it's lust 'cause neither one of us trust each other so we fuck 'til we bust and we cuss each other out we know what it's about shout 'til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth fist fight 'til we turn this mother out then apologize after laughter pain it's insane we're back in the same chapter again and it's sad but it's true when i'm layin' here with you there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause   the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you more you don't want me i just want you more i buy you flowers you throw 'em at me i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 'cause you love me and i love you more   'cause i hate you do you hate me good 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you you fuck other people and i fuck other people you're a slut but i'm equal i'm a mutt we're both evil in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it 'cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it we can make accusations people spread rumors but they ain't got proof 'til they do it's just the two of us it's you and me 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me but you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed if you didn't i wouldn't be hittin'  yeah i would 'cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to that would be this soft and warm so it's off and on usually more off than on but at least we know that we share this common bond you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on i hope the only reason that i cope is 'cause of that fact and plus i can bust in that and that's why   the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you more you don't want me i just want you more i buy you flowers you throw 'em at me i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 'cause you love me and i love you more   i can never understand it that's why i don't try from junior high until we both die it's silly oh why must we try is it really so rough that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff try to pull each other's legs until the other begs we're lyin' to ourselves that's the beauty of it yeah 'cause we truly love each other that's why we always fightin' all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night and it's clear it ain't gonna change it's pentup rage we both had we both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else we've both been someone else's someone else problem is neither one wants help it's an addiction and it can't be fixed our family's mixed up there's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit and they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time on every song every lyric and every rhyme all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo what you put me through fuckin' whooptydo but i won't be made a fool of if this is true love you wouldn't do what you did last time you wouldn't screw up this time 'cause this time girl i'm tellin' you what you do it again i'm fuckin' you up   no matter what you say or what you do i'ma hunt you down 'til i find you no matter where you run i'll be right there right behind you in your nightmares so i brought you the flowers and the candy all the times that you threw it back at me told me you hate me you gon' hate me more when you find out you can't escape me whore   the more you put me through the more it makes me wanna come back to you you say you hate me i just love you more you don't want me i just want you more i buy you flowers you throw 'em at me i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 'cause you love me and i love you more

eminem  manix yo man yo marsh man yo you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself what of the homies man oh you want one about the posse alright   eminem ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride  verse eminem well foolish pride has a lot of things to say you got foolish pride like you got tooth decay but tooth decay is another problem so let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it now when i talk about foolish pride i mean blacks and whites taking different sides when blacks and whites take different sides unity never happens and we will subside we will subside and hatred will release and everything will just crush that peace but when we crush that peace you see we start hatin' each other but remember you are my brother and you are my sister just like i'm a mister i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her i kissed her i placed it on her cheek and she didn't come back 'til next week now it was next week and she was back again wanting to kiss a white kid so she was my girlfriend we started going out but that's okay because we were black and white blacks and whites sometimes mix but black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks so i'ma say like this don't date a black girl take it as a diss if you want but if you don't i'ma tell you like this i surely won't never date a black girl because blacks only want your money and that shit ain't funny so i'ma say look honey why do you do this you know you step up to me like you a brutus then you try to grab my spinach because it's green and that's cash so get outta here 'cause i don't need your ass i said that before but that's okay because like i said you're a whore black girls and white girls just don't mix because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks white girls are good i like white girls i like white girls all over the world white girls are fine and they blow my mind and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme 'cause black girls i really don't like we don't mix it's like riding a bike when you're peddling hard uphill both ways you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you i'm giving you a little advice don't date a black girl if you do it once you won't do it twice you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money and that ain't funny so i'ma say look honey i've already said that before but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore so when mike catch on the bass line that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time i'll get straight to the point black girls are bitches that's why i'ma tell you you better pull up your britches 'cause all that cash is making your ass drag from the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad i mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy now that's pretty wrong but you're just ganking but that's okay because you need a god damn spanking from me the funky mm i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm i'm busting a freestyle just like this i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed but when howard gets pissed that's okay because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it i'll cross that  when i come to it 'cause i forgot the  but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl she turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl a wack girl because black girls ain't funny all they want is your goddamn money they take you for everything you've got and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand so i'ma kick it to you just like this how does the  go i forgot but that's okay 'cause i'ma tell you in stride i'ma say ole foolish pride   eminem ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh date a white girl 'cause they got the raw hide

verse i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping i keep dreaming of death and i'm hearing people screaming the devil's spirit's trapped inside me and i want it out i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit i'm lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there i feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes door's open and close by themselves books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum it got silent then all these voices said come follow me into the gates of hell i heard 'em yell welcome to the norman bates motel i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess and told me that's just for starters satan'll be in to see me later to see if i'm interested in being partners

i'm a little nutty and i know it but if you go back and take a look at my history you will see that i am not the only one who's off his rocker there were many before me i was always labeled the black sheep of the family what a bad seed i'd grow to be but if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree  interlude haha haha haha haha alright look i'mma tell you the story from my side maybe you'll understand check it out   you done witnessed unexplainable shit too insane to explain people run from what they just don't get maybe shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit did i spit too soon should i have spoon fed 'em it but i was just so eager to prove i was even worth bein' in the same league or the room of the people of whom i was in every now and then i look up like i was seekin' approval was it because of the pigment of my skin or was it a figment of my imagination maybe it bothered me more than it did them maybe it wasn't a big deal back then but to me it was see what it was was i had developed a complex from being judged proof spit his verse now i'm next let's see who balks i'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs i get a reaction from usually the first thumb was from proof and the rest of the crew backed him up and no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals it was real we just wanted tickets for that meal   sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree   ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg 'cause she said that i had a baby sister who fell out of the window i was too young to remember kansas city projects i was like fivesix and how come i remember malcolm isaac and boogy if it was the projects in missouri 'cause those were my best friends until isaac took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back and ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and seventysome stitches which is to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture of a fictitious little sister who never existed and this is why a part of my life's so twisted but i can never be as sick as that bitch is and by the way that picture's one of my relatives   sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree   you probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain to see why everything i say is so insane what's different about my brain that separates me from other players in this game on the surface it may seem like a scheme or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy but that's the last thing i need is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me and i am not a g never claimed to be i gave my vest to cashis just hope he don't need it more than me but we'll see 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef but if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek come on   sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree   yeah and i'm the crazy one right whatever then let me be the crazy one balalalalalalalalalala cuckoo cuckoo tweet

other man  i stand in slapped by the wind as i begin do you know who i am and many reply with a grin yes i'm tired of being obtruded why should i be secluded i've got a brand new horn to be tooted to sum it up in a nutshell eminem will you kick it for me so i find myself in a certain obligatory a place that i dwell in fell into some wonderful productions to make up for lost time and then it brings obstruction finally let loose unloading the stockpile a mental projectile i aim at the reptile i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus is there a reason for this the hindrance is aggravating how many times will it take you before you realize you're fading fading from existence cause simulations are dead there's so much more to learn and pages left to be read so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor words can weigh a ton therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  scratched samples  yeah it's another  very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side but i see no borderline from under this colorblind and some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred but then i'm finally about to put an end to the hatred wrong the world would never endure to arguing awaking to the absence of unity is startling oh foolish pride what the hell are you trying to do you cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable you're graceless bland you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless damn you're dull it's time you faced this here taste this straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles the date of my birth on the earth the deliverance of a starchild blessed with formidable talent and versatility but with such a power there comes a responsibilty to infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear to form an alliance is something even the giants fear so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend  scratched samples  yeah it's another  eminem  you know i don't understand why we all just can't get along you hate me but you know me and what i stand for no so then why do you speak for me and every other white man when you that we're your enemy  on the floor lies a broken door cause i'm not to be spoken for stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore rarely do you see the lighter side of me i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry but  is isolated apologies are exhausted feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted switch to the opposite now scenes are being reenacted pull up that boy by his roots destroy him quick his fracture's obviating we hate him his patterns past us huh always fighting for the position of top dog that spot's already occupied and i don't play leapfrog cause i do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine but i'm always having to prove myself time after time oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast judged from the past and he's put last and others with nothing to say stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like danny kaye here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please i've got a craving

you have reached the voicemail box of suck it  hey em what's going on it's paul uh i wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the monster video we got dates for rihanna and she's gonna come out to detroit and we can get it shot we've got some concepts together based on your conversations with rich lee and i think we're ready to go  so the basic concept is sort of like an inceptiontype of vibe the whole video sort of happens inside of your head and rihanna in the beginning is gonna act as your therapist and you answer into her office you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off we're not really sure and next thing you know you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career and there's various stops along the way we're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments  i had to go home and get my straightjacket redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because i don't remember it dr dre would say i'm glad to see you got your coat back on the way things should be  the scene from the my name is video with you in the straightjacket and dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office therethe song which recieved an oscar for you yes lose yourself will also be included we're gonna go back and revisit the way i am with you jumping off the building falling through the sky with everything moving past you and then we're also gonna do the classic grammy scene with you and elton john performing stan  eminem does an impersonation of elton john performing stan at the    grammy performance i can't see it all even if i could it'll all be grey but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  so all these things are going on in your head you're travelling through the elevator looking at it from a new perspective with you watching yourself and then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator you come out and you see this sort of caged beast and the beast is actually slim shady  slim shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on and then you see it's actually yourself and slim shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them and the idea that you keep feeding slim shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it and the songs'll keep coming back out  so it's really kind of a trip it's very surreal less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey  so anyway call me back after you listen to this um i sent the treatment over read through it and get ready for some really long days later  i'm done it's a wrap uh i never want to perform in these clothes again way too small i'm try'na go like quadruple x next time so these clothes are a fucking wrap too peace out  and goodnight give it up for him folks thank you very much

spoken eminem public service announcement and another annoying message from slim shady due to a massive amount of bootlegging no thanks to this fucking guy dj whoo kid and constant downloading people are no longer buying cds so that we can get paid for our fucking work they are just continuing to get songs for free teenagers older folks and little fucking brats alike see what they do is buy computers strictly pick songs that they like and burn them on cds or put them on ipods causing major decrease in sound scan putting music retail in a tremendous slump causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales and be forced to tour causing more stress arguments with my wife not being able to see my kids drink more take more pills punch more people in the face hate the world and end up in rehab this has been a public service announcement and an excuse to vent by marshall mathers not that i wouldn't have done the same thing if i could get music for free when i was a kid but now that i rap for a living buy my goddamn cds but in the meantime buy this obie trice bootleg from dj whoo kid and put more money in his pocket thanks
walk on water   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes   eminem why are expectations so high is it the bar i set my arms i stretch but i can't reach a far cry from it or it's in my grasp but as soon as i grab squeeze i lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze into the dark i plummet now the sky's blackening i know the mark's high butter flies rip apart my stomach knowin' that no matter what bars i come with you're gonna harp gripe and that's a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these as pressure increases like khakis i feel the ice cracking because   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes   eminem it's the curse of the standard that the first of the mathers discs set always in search of the that i haven't spit yet will this step just be another misstep to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect i've garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless and it always feels like i'm hittin' the mark 'til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart like this shit is garbage god's given me all this still i feel no different regardless kids look to me as a god this is retarded if only they knew it's a facade and it's exhaustive and i try not to listen to nonsense but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence mission accomplished i'm not godsent nas rakim 'pac big james todd smith and i'm not prince so   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes  post skylar grey 'cause i'm only human just like you making mistakes oh if you only knew i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh   eminem it's true i'm a rubik's  a beautiful mess at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest a flawed human i guess but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex pectations and meet 'em but first the speedom verse now big sean he's goin' too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom there was a time i had the world by the balls eatin' out my palm every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on and now i'm gettin' frowned and clowned on but the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's deshaun am i lucky to be around this long begs the question though especially after the methadone as yesterday fades and the dresden home is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn the crowds are gone and it's time to wash out the blonde sales decline the curtain's drawn they're closin' the set i'm still pokin' my head from out behind and everyone who has doubt remind now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes and as i grow outta sight outta mind i might go outta mine 'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine but when i do fall from these heights though i'll be fine i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes  post skylar grey 'cause i'm only human just like you i've been making my mistakes oh if you only knew i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh if i walked on water i would drown   eminem 'cause i'm just a man but as long as i got a mic i'm godlike so me and you are not alike bitch i wrote stan  stan   skylar grey my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all and even if i could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad   eminem as stan dear slim i wrote you but you still ain't callin' i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom i sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em there probably was a

morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all and even if i could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  love the way you lie   skylar grey just gonna stand there and watch me burn well that's all right because i like the way it hurts just gonna stand there and hear me cry well that's all right because i love the way you lie i love the way you lie   eminem i can't tell you what it really is i can only tell you what it feels like and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight high off her love drunk from her hate it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me she fuckin' hates me and i love it wait where you going i'm leaving you no you ain't come back we're runnin' right back here we go again it's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed i snap who's that dude i don't even know his name i laid hands on her i'll never stoop so low again i guess i don't know my own strength   skylar grey just gonna stand there and watch me burn well that's all right because i like the way it hurts just gonna stand there

music  i had met paul em's manager a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road we just worked out it was meant to be at this time i think it's unlike any current hip hop songs if you listen to what's going on in hip hop this is not what this is em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days and it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop  we were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up it started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record the song sort of evolves it started one way it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song  and i felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction em was gonna go in vocally and then when i heard the vocals that was pretty exciting because it was not at all what i was expecting and just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it it's so well done and so smart and so funny it's just great in this song we ended up using a wired  and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed  it reminds me of old hip hop videos and i think it's really entertaining and i look forward to see it all put together and done but in the shooting stages the pieces i've seen look really entertaining

rhyming like this on the mic here's the way that i rhyme so naturally and actually when i grab the mic all the people say mm you're one of the funkiest mc's out today and i say i agree because i am a funky dope slamming mc i slam them back daddy eveytime i grab the mic and say i wanna rap daddy but you can't because i take it grab the mic and after i'm done i break it when i'm done i just slam the microphone and cram it right in your asshole because 'asshole' and 'cram the' didn't rhyme but that's alright 'cause i'm jamming on the microphone 'cause i'm slamming busting out lyrics and you like to examine my style that i'm doing but if you step to me pursuing i'll ruin all your hopes and dreams 'cause i work with my man he's on my team my man manix is on my side every time the  they say damn how'd you make a beat like that ma'am and i say i'm not a ma'am i'm a sir and if you step to me your eyes'll be blurred   one two one two mic checka one two one two one two mic checka check one two mic checka one two one two mic check three four six seven eight   mic check one two do unto others as you would have them do to you no that's not the way i work because when i rhyme i'm a jerk i grab the mic and start dissing all these mc's and try to put them into submission take them out for the count because the amount i throw is so deaf word deaf didn't rhyme but i on your windshield just like a turd every time that i rhyme you know that i'm going to climb to the tip tip top and i'm not going to stop 'cause i grab the mic and dopda dop dop i fucked up but that's alright because my luck's up no it's not 'cause here i am i got a lot to give and i don't live positive now i'm not saying i'm negative but if i grab the mic i do mega kits every time that i grab the mic you know that mm is gonna be rolling his tongue just like this and then i go do a funky rhyme and if any mc steps up he gets fucking dissed bad don't call me dad vanilla ice said that that made me mad so when i step to the mic know that i gotta clear my throat and excite i'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so i can bust some material i take it around my leg and then all the mc's wanna beg and say yo please give me a turn i say no because it's my turn to burn and i bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that i do 'cause you're dissed you're dissed so bad every time sure he don't get a turn and he's starting to get mad but i'm just going to take the mic i'm not gonna give it to him because i am so damn hyped in the place to be rhyming like this 'cause i'm an mc rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat it's kinda gay like liberace but hey listen to the words that i display every time i kick a rhyme this way you know that the star is worthwhile every time i grab the mic i'm longer than i mile   i waste no time when i can't flip i caper i cut your butt up like g floyd like paper when i bust a rhyme i'm a stud that's what i like to say jump on my pud girly girly would you like to fuck me fuck me in my house early or late i don't care let's make a date 'cause i don't pump weights to get dates just because i'm huge i bust a lyric but i get greedy like a scrooge when i grab the mic it's kinda stingy i kick rhymes that ain't dingy when i bust i'm like forcillin you try to grab the mic and force it again but you can't 'cause you are speechless and i get sandy like teachers i get sandy i grab the mic handy it's so i can get candy when i bust the shit i get like a noogie then i boogie boogie on down because every time that i kick a rhyme i just 'dud' i meant to say 'do' but i got an addiction to friction every time i kick nonfiction nonfiction science every time i grab the mic i got the alliance right behind me stepping into the   's you know you'll try me and you'll die g so don't even try it i don't buy it so you'd better keep quiet 'cause you're into it ain't nothing but to do it    you'd better catch up 'cause you're trailing you'd better put springs in your ass and jump like van halen every time i bust a rhyme i get like a panther if you're lying that slander 'cause you're lying like berry saunders every time i grab the mic i get married and i like to kick a rhyme that i pick every time i pick the mic up i stick a dick right up your ass like a faggot you're gonna die be crawling with maggots every time i dread you like hair i said you'd better get  on your underwear you'd better run 'cause if you don't afraid you'll be seeing a ghost like a rake you ain't an eighth of me every time i grab the mic girls try to act so faithfully but i say no don't be a fan just try to step to my dick and act like a man no that don't make no sense but every time  i cut class like a pair of scissors i get so damn hyped on the mic 'cause every time i step to the forefront i like to wonder on to something that i'm drawn to every time i grab the mic and pass it to sean he gets so deaf but i'm not gonna pass it yet 'cause i burn like acid vet word i'm a stick like a trident 'cause you need guidance

are you feeling good about the album at this point um that's a tough question man for the most part yeah but i don't know if i ever feel totally great about a record when i put it out with every record that i put out someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when i listen to my own music i just hear flaws in it like i hear 'oh fuck i could have done this better or that better' and i'll work it to death obviously if i wasn't comfortable with it i wouldn't put it out but from the beginning ever since my career started i don't know if i've ever been totally like this is completely it  in this last crunch what have you been working on i guess you would say last minute jitters of fuck are the vocals loud enough can you hear what i'm saying on this part is the beat right are the vocals too loud' if i could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that i rapped over and put them out i would do that 'cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it  but you're not changing lyrics or anything like that it's just all mix and sound stuff it's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part because when i decide to keep a song that's pretty much it like if it doesn't work i pretty much know right away right when i get it in the car and take it home  rolling stone's review of eminem's the marshall mathers lp   so why did you dye your hair blonde again um i'll say that one was manager paul rosenberg's idea in the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit i had thought about it and once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be he hit me with the idea and i was like yo you know i thought about that right and he was like well you know why not and i was like i don't know how it's gonna look i haven't had it in how many fucking years five six years i was like i'm so used to it being dark you know so i just tried it and i was like fuck it  did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording not really honestly because i already had most of the songs and i don't know if i'm gonna keep it like this or how long i'm gonna keep it but for right now it is what it is and i feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record  for recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff you recorded    songs or something or at least you had    beats so was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around i feel like right now i'm probably working harder than i've ever worked in my life and i've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during the eminem show which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time just being so busy with the eminem show and doing the   mile movie and the soundtrack and the score to the movie this is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly  that's crazy once i had the direction that i wanted to go and you know calling it the marshall mathers lp  obviously i knew that there might be certain expectations like i wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that so i wanted to make sure that i had the right songs to be able to call it that so a lot of recording a lot of songs that people probably will never hear we hit a couple of road blocks there were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever and just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like fuck man i feel like it needs this or this to paint the whole picture  a lot of people maybe even you think the original is your best album it's probably my favorite i think some of them are my favorites for different reasons hate to even say that about my own record but i mean the first three records i think they may have captured a time period and then i think i pretty much probably have publicly said you know encore and relapse wasn't  it was just a different time  you've been hard on relapse but tyler the creator says that it's his favorite hiphop record in years he loves that record yeah he tells me that every time i see him i don't hate the record i want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs and you know i don't know if i necessarily found that balance yet because i was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like ha ha this is funny you know walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it because when i got sober it was like  i've said this before  but it just was like oh shit i can think straight again so i don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs writing songs that felt like something that brought some kind of emotion i ran accents into the ground i got stuck on that kind of serial killer crazy vibe and just kind of went with it  on recovery obviously the world came to you on that one how do you feel now about that record i feel like that record i finally got back to where i was at maybe during the eminem show like creatively and songwriting i guess i mean obviously recovery was the first time i had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp aside from working with dre it was like i always wanted to produce my own records because producing is fun to me too one of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had es on them it's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words because my own hooks i already know what i mean when i write them the way that i do music is like regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have i always want to try to go as hard lyrically as i can so regardless if the beat feels like wow maybe this could be played on the radio i'm not like maybe radio would play this so i'll just wing it like i always have looked at it like i want to approach every record from an mcs' aspect  so how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to the marshall mathers lp how did you decide to make your life miserable like that well here's what it is it's not necessarily a sequel  okay as much as it is a revisitation  like this is a different time period in my life so there's not gonna be like continuations of every song or anything like that to me it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia one of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that you know retro shit and try to make it current like bring it up to date  so did seeking out rick rubin come from that direction you were like why don't i go back to the source paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and i was like fuck man another thing with this record is that i kind of got back into producing more on recovery i wanted to focus more on writing and not have to worry abut making the beats on relapse i think it was mostly all dre so i kind of started producing again a little bit i was kind of in the middle of that when paul had mentioned that and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and i don't know if that's what made paul reach out to rick or if rick reached out to him but as soon as i heard he was interested i was like yo just let me finish this up and let's go see him  you've called rick yoda  was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career yoda voice learning i did um yeah i mean the best part about rick's vibe is he's very zenlike in the sense of just let it happen the weird thing about it is nine times out   we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right you know he's almost like a coach  he's very psychological right yeah the guy's got his shoes off laughs working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere he's not afraid to try anything i kind of felt in the same way i felt and still feel to this day as far as like wanting to impress dre we talked at his house and then i think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats i told him that i had started experimenting with some more retro sounds so we just sat down and started picking shit out and i would start writing to them and next time i'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it the dude's got so many ideas man one of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the rick rubin scratches when he fucking scratches some shit it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it not that it's offtime or anything like that but it's just like  it's fucking weird i don't even know how to explain it you just know that he scratched it i don't know if that even makes sense or not it's like a simple scratch like a basic kind of thing but it's so fucking dope when you hear it it's just it's vintage him and plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit  did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio oh he's got some shit in the stash yeah definitely  so much has changed in hiphop since you started producing  did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff um not necessarily because like i feel like i just do whatever feels right obviously i pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse but i don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing that's no offense to anyone else  basically if there are outside influences that are current you let that come in from the other producers but your shit is your shit yeah that's exactly it more currentsounding shit i leave to them and not that i don't feel like my shit sounds current but it's not the exact same thing and i think i've updated as well  on the new song legacy you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid what does it take to get back in that mindset at your age i always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said he ain't shit or bullied or whatever it felt like one of them selfempowerment songs everybody i believe wants to show the world that one day i'm gonna be this one day i'm gonna be that everybody has goals aspirations or whatever and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them like if you haven't been kicked or whatever if you never went through    tribulations tribulations and shit like that then you're perfect and fuck you anyways so everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted like you don't matter oh yeah i'm gonna show you so it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy  into what i leave behind when i'm gone and i always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me there's many many songs that got me through a lot of shit  i just love that you rhyme onyx with comics on that song i don't know if anyone will get this like this is supernerdy but the rhyming words in that song never change and that's just one of the things that i do to try to challenge myself i wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed  you've praised the beastie boys' evolution but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a the disrespect for women has got to be through moment i mean listen my sense of humor has certainly not gone away i realize that i'm an adult a grownass man and i don't know what i'll be doing a year from now   years from now but i don't think that my tongueincheekness will ever go away i guess it's just a part of my personality i always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well if one song is darker or talking about a sad subject i don't want to make a whole album of that of being a downer i don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity you gotta try and find that right balance and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting in other words recording till i get it and if i record    fucking songs and i don't have what i feel like i need yet to make the body of work then i'm gonna keep going and keep recording  you've written a bunch of your own hooks and even sing some of them where does your sense of melody come from that's a good question i would want to say that it's stemming from early hiphop rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies at least on the shit that i grew up on i don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is i can only hum something but i think it just comes from all the data that i've collected in my years of listening to music and you know fuck man i think that as hiphop started evolving there was more melody in it people were starting to sing hooks even like early slick rick  sings hey young world  those kind of things maybe i took it somewhere different at times i don't know  maybe it's just pure instinct honestly that's probably what it is i don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but i just don't know where i get that sense from you know what i'm saying i'm not a singer singer i just know what's in key and what's not  having kendrick lamar on your album did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you i completely respect what kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp that he's on aftermath only made sense to me he came to detroit we kicked it for a few minutes you know and i felt the vibe of what he's like and everything and you know he's a super cool and super humble dude when we did that record i think that was actually a week or two before he did the to control  is there advice you would give him at this point i don't know if he needs advice he seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders man he's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one he's like a hiphop head man he just loves hiphop and obviously the way that he did the control verse it was almost like if you get mad at him then you might look foolish he set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other mc is already thinking or you should be thinking  fundamentally do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog i think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour day by day with me that whole rap god record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek so i mean do i want to feel like that maybe sometimes again it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best again that's why kendrick's worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking if you don't want to be the best then why are you rapping    read more

few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on

devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake
